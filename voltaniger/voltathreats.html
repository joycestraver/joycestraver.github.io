        <p>Climate change related events, such as heavy rainfall, flooding, drought, sea level rise, storm surge and increasing temperatures are causing changes in the delta system. The increased rainfall is causing lots of <b>flooding in the delta</b>. Not only rainfall but also sea level rise is causing floods in the area.

        <p>The dam, which is build at the end of lake Volta is also causing threats to the people and the environment. Because of the dam lots of places became suitable for lots of growth of the schistosomo host snails. The snails have caused <b>infections</b> and became a public health issue. Since the building of the dam people with that infection has increased from 10% of the population to <b>80-90%</b>.

        <p>After damming the river the floods and erosion did not stop and <b>almost half of the people living in the Keta region were underwater</b>. Ghana decided to build a <b>sea defense</b>, to protect the people living next to the Keta basin from floods. They build a large highway along the coast.

        <p>It should be noted, however, that some of the <b>migration may be directly linked to climate and/or environmental change</b>.
